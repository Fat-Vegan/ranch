Overview
This repository provides Python projects that use AI to address common ranching challenges, such as monitoring livestock health, optimizing feed and grazing, predicting cattle growth, and implementing virtual fencing. Each project includes example code and can be adapted to real-world ranching data from sensors, GPS devices, or APIs.
Projects
1. Livestock Health Monitoring System
Description: Analyzes data from livestock wearables (e.g., heart rate, activity) to detect health anomalies using machine learning.Use Case: Early detection of illness or stress to improve animal welfare and reduce vet costs.Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seabornFeatures:

Detects anomalies in health metrics.
Visualizes data for quick insights.
Extensible for real-time sensor integration (e.g., HerdDogg, Allflex).File: livestock_health_monitoring.py

2. Grazing Rotation Planner
Description: Optimizes rotational grazing by analyzing pasture quality and weather data to recommend grazing schedules.Use Case: Prevents overgrazing and improves pasture health.Libraries: pandas, geopandas, requestsFeatures:

Recommends pastures based on grass quality and recovery time.
Integrates weather forecasts via APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
Supports geospatial pasture mapping.File: grazing_rotation_planner.py

3. Feed Optimization Tool
Description: Uses linear programming to optimize feed rations based on cost, nutrition, and cattle needs.Use Case: Minimizes feed costs while meeting nutritional requirements.Libraries: pulp, pandas, numpyFeatures:

Calculates cost-effective feed mixes.
Supports multiple feed types and constraints.
Extensible for real-time price data.File: feed_optimization.py

4. Cattle Weight Prediction Model
Description: Predicts cattle weight using machine learning based on age, feed intake, and historical data.Use Case: Guides feeding strategies and sales planning.Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlibFeatures:

Predicts weight with linear regression.
Visualizes growth trends.
Adaptable to more complex models (e.g., Random Forest).File: cattle_weight_prediction.py

5. Virtual Fencing Alert System
Description: Monitors livestock locations via GPS and sends alerts if cattle stray beyond virtual boundaries.Use Case: Reduces labor for fencing and improves herd management.Libraries: geopandas, shapely, smtplibFeatures:

Defines virtual boundaries with geospatial data.
Sends email alerts for strays.
Extensible for real-time GPS integration (e.g., Vence).File: virtual_fencing_alert.py

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/ranching-ai-projects.git
cd ranching-ai-projects


Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.
Install required libraries:pip install -r requirements.txt


For projects using APIs (e.g., weather data), obtain API keys from providers like OpenWeatherMap.

Usage

Navigate to the project folder (e.g., livestock_health_monitoring/).
Update the sample data in each script with your ranch’s data (e.g., sensor readings, GPS coordinates).
Run the script:python livestock_health_monitoring.py


Follow the project-specific instructions in each script’s comments for customization.
For real-time data, integrate APIs or IoT devices as noted in the code.

Requirements

Python: 3.8 or higher
Libraries (listed in requirements.txt):pandas>=1.5.0
scikit-learn>=1.2.0
matplotlib>=3.5.0
seaborn>=0.12.0
geopandas>=0.12.0
shapely>=2.0.0
requests>=2.28.0
pulp>=2.7.0
numpy>=1.23.0


Optional: API keys for weather (OpenWeatherMap) or GPS data providers.
Hardware: Raspberry Pi or IoT devices for sensor integration (optional).

Challenges and Considerations

Data Quality: Ensure accurate sensor or manual data inputs for reliable AI predictions.
Connectivity: Rural areas may need satellite internet (e.g., Starlink) for cloud-based tools.
Cost: Initial setup for sensors or APIs may be costly; start with open-source tools.
Scalability: Test projects on small datasets before scaling to larger herds or pastures.
Training: Ranch staff may need training to use AI tools effectively.
